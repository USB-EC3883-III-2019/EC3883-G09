Module "MBit1"     (component MultiBitIO)
   - MBit1_GetDir -Returns selected direction.
   - MBit1_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. Component calls ancestor's [GetVal] for each bit and 
                composes value according its order. That is [direction] independent, for details look into ancestor 
                documentation.
   - MBit1_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. Component calls ancestor's [PutVal] for each bit 
                with corresponded value. That is [direction] independent, for details look into ancestor documentation.  This 
                method is enabled only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - MBit1_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. For specified bit is called 
                ancestor's [GetVal] method. That is [direction] independent, for details look into ancestor documentation. Pins 
                are addressed form zero, where 0 is equaled to LSB. In case incorrept pin number value is used method returns 0.
   - MBit1_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. For specified bit is 
                called ancestor's [PutVal] method. That is [direction] independent, for details look into ancestor 
                documentation..  This method is enabled only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_. Pins are 
                addressed form zero, where 0 is equaled to LSB.
   - MBit1_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)].  This 
                method is enabled only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_). Pins are addressed form zero, where 
                0 is equaled to LSB.
   - MBit1_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ].  This method is enabled only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_). Pins are addressed form 
                zero, where 0 is equaled to LSB.
   - MBit1_NegBit -Negates (inverts) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit,!GetBit(Bit)
                )].  This method is enabled only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_). Pins are addressed form 
                zero, where 0 is equaled to LSB.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08QE128_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
